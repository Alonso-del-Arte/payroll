# Payroll Processing

WORK IN PROGRESS: A rudimentary payroll processing program such as would be part of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software package.

Eventually, the program will have a graphical user interface (GUI). For the now, the interface is text-based on the command line. Run `portals.text.Demo` for a demonstration.
