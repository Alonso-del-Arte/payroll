# Payroll Processing

WORK IN PROGRESS: A rudimentary payroll processing program such as would be part of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software package. The idea isn't to supplant existing payroll processing programs, but rather to use the program as a source for examples of various concepts in object-oriented programming.

Eventually, the program will have a graphical user interface (GUI). For the now, the interface is text-based on the command line. Run `portals.text.Demo` for a demonstration.
